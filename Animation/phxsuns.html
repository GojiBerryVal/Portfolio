  <p class="description">Before I started working on anything, I created a reference to plan out the timing for the animation. The final product did not 
    follow the exact timing, but it was a good starting point and made it easier dial in on the speed and height of the ball as it bounces.</p>

  <p class="description">After I was done planning the animation, I created my own assets since it was a lot more simple than finding ones that would load in Maya.
    All I needed were a few shaders for the models and they were ready for rigging.</p>

  <p class="description">Making the animation simple and repeatable was the goal of this rig. There are no visible controls, but the basketball can be animated to
    perform 3 different actions; translate, squash/stretch, and rotate. Each action was put into its own group, where I made sure only the necessary attributes for
    that group in the hierarchy could be seen and animated.</p>

  <p class="description">The camera was placed on a motion path so that it could move along at a consistent pace. I decided not to attach the aim locator to a motion
    path so I could animate it freely.</p>

  <p class="description">I took this quick render at the end to ensure that everything looked good before I rendered an image sequence.</p>
