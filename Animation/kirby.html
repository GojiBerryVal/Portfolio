  <h1>Kirby's 30th Birthday</h1>
    <h2>2022</h2>
      <div class="descriptionTitle">
        <p>For this project, I focused on creating a 2D animation that celebrates the 30th birthday of beloved Nintendo character, Kirby. I began by drafting
            a few storyboards and doing a lot of research on my main character. Once I knew who I was working with and what direction the story is headed in,
            my next task was to create and find assets that I could use to animate. Not everything in this animation was created by me, but nonetheless, the
            goal was just to create a captivating story. I then created a blocking stage to figure out if my story and animations made sense. After a handful
            of refinements, I animated the assets I found and created, exported the animation, and edited it down to what you see here. The tools I used to
            accomplish this were Illustrator, After Effects, and Premiere.</p>
